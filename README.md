# Wordpress Plugin to expose your blog via the SPXP protocol

Exposes your blog via the Social Profile Exchange Protocol so your friends can
follow your updates using any SPXP client of their choice, like the HeyFolks app.

## Installation
As usual: Copy the `/hfa-spxp` folder to `/wp-content/plugins` of your wordpress
instance, activate the plugin and then adjust it to your liking on the SPXP
settings page.

## Description
The Social Profile Exchange Protocol (SPXP) defines how independent clients and
servers can exchange information about social profiles, focusing on privacy,
security and individual sovereignty.  
It aims to create a social media network consisting of independent actors rather
than being controlled by a single entity.

This plugin makes your wordpress instance available via this protocol so that
people can start following your blog posts with any SPXP client of their liking,
like the [Hey Folks app](https://HeyFolks.app/).

You can set the profile picture and a longer "About" text in the settings and
tweak how posts on our Blog are presented via SPXP.

This plugin is not yet available for multisite installations.
